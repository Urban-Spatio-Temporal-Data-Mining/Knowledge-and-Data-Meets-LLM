# Knowledge and Data Engineering Meets Large Language Models: Challenges and Opportunities Workshop @ICDE'26 ([KDExLLM](https://urban-spatio-temporal-data-mining.github.io/Knowledge-and-Data-Meets-LLM/))

## Workshop Objectives
This workshop on the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge and Data Engineering is a pioneering event at top-tier conferences. It brings together experts to share recent challenges and opportunities, aiming to inspire future research. With oral presentations and poster sessions, the workshop will provide a platform for researchers from natural language processing (NLP), knowledge engineering, and database management to discuss ideas, review past work, and explore new directions. The focus is on the synergy between LLMs and knowledge and data engineering from two aspects. The first explores how LLMs empower Knowledge Base (KB) and Database (DB) management tasks, such as data cleansing, relation inference, and query processing. The second examines how KBs and DBs enhance LLMs, e.g., through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-modal data management, and more. By including participants from academia and industry, the workshop aims to connect practical applications with research, encouraging collaboration that will shape the future of intelligent KB and DB systems.

## Workshop Topics and Themes
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has introduced novel approaches to knowledge base (KB) and database (DB) management, bringing both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, LLMs enable new methods for various KB and DB tasks, from data cleansing, relation inference, to knob tuning, and query processing. On the other hand, integrating KBs and DBs to enhance LLM capabilities offers promising directions for addressing key issues such as hallucination and data privacy, which remain major barriers to broader adoption. Although there are prospects for LLM-empowered KB and DB systems and KB and DB-enhanced LLMs, as well as  achievements, this research area is still in its early stages. To further advance the field, it is essential to explore the interplay between KBs, DBs, and LLMs, and to gain insights from both academia and industry.
